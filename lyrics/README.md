the morning’s full of sun and thunder
when drowsy spirits take their leave
  when drowsy mothers/fathers take their leave
you’re hungry for the end of summer
  you’re wishing for the fall of summer
  you’re wishing for the end of summer
so come with me

far down the forest ways we’ll wander
along the walk of giants’ feet
  and learn the walk of giants’ feet
  along the steps of giants’ feet
  so deep the secret sounds we’ll breathe
  among the secret sounds we’ll sleep
  that still remember giant feet
among the secret sounds we’ll slumber
while thunder speaks
  between the leaves
  and you won’t be
  and you will leave

rising all the nights you came home
tossing in your dreams, you
never had to call my name once
waiting in the weeds

now in your blood, new days are pooling
and on your tongue, you taste new seas
* remaining in this place is easy
  * remaining in this place would be easy
but let us leave

rising all the nights you came home
tossing in your dreams, you
never had to call my name once
waiting in the weeds

ash on the stone and both my hands
  ash on the rocks and both my hands
  ash on the palms of both my hands
  ash on my tongue
autumn in red bloom takes the land
fumes on the red mountainside at noon
* ash in the rainfall is coming soon
  * ash in the rainfall approaching you
  ash in the rain is coming soon
  ash in the rainfall that's coming soon

  who is the king that is coming soon?

rising all the nights you came home
tossing in your dreams, you
never had to call my name once
waiting in the weeds
