Rising All The Nights
=====================

This is a song about not getting lulled into complacence.

Story Summary
-------------
You had fallen asleep. Even in your dreams, you knew in your heart that you were sleeping.

I came and whispered that truth you already knew.

You awoke and followed me.

Who's Talking
-------------
You slept deeply. But just on the other side of your dreams,
you could feel the swarm and buzz of waking life. As you could feel it,
I could feel you. I could feel you, and I wanted what you wanted.
